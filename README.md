# **Izutu:**

Welcome fans of all things horror. Izutu is a site in which users can create a list of horror movies to watch and then post a review after they have watched them. This is the client side of a PERN stack full CRUD application. The server side of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/amtodd999/red-badge-project-server).

## **Deployed Project:**

The final version deployed to heroku can be found at [https://izutu-amt.herokuapp.com/](https://izutu-amt.herokuapp.com/)

**Made and Styled with:**

- React
- Styled-Components
- Reactstrap

**Project Requirements:**

The server portion of my app can be found [here](https://github.com/CLTsolutions/takeoff_server). This site was completed during a Web Development bootcamp at Eleven Fifty Academy. Requirements included:

- User authentication and registration using a POST method to a server
- This app includes Films and Reviews both successfully create via POST, retrieve via GET, update via PUT, and delete via DELETE methods to a server.
- Form validation for user login
- Uses react-router-dom to navigate through the application
- React Legacy (Class Components, Lifecycle methods, State Management, etc.)
- React Styling Libraries
- Strong Typing with TypeScript
- Role Based Access Control
- Fetching data from a deployed server

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
